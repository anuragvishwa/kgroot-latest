# 🚀 Quick Start - RCA Quality Validation

## 5-Minute Validation

### Step 1: Check What's Working Now

```bash
# Quick Neo4j check - Confidence coverage
docker exec -it kgroot_latest-neo4j-1 cypher-shell -u neo4j -p password "
MATCH ()-[r:POTENTIAL_CAUSE]->()
WITH
  count(CASE WHEN r.confidence IS NULL THEN 1 END) as null_count,
  count(*) as total
RETURN
  total as total_links,
  round((total - null_count) * 100.0 / total, 2) as confidence_coverage_percent
"
```

**Expected**: `confidence_coverage_percent > 95%`

### Step 2: Run Full Validation

```bash
cd /Users/anuragvishwa/Anurag/kgroot_latest/validation
chmod +x run-validation.sh
./run-validation.sh
```

### Step 3: Check Your Results

Look for these key numbers:

```
✅ Pass Criteria:
   1. Confidence Coverage > 95%: [PASS/FAIL]
   2. Zero Invalid Temporal Links: [PASS/FAIL]
   3. A@3 (if measured): Should be > 85%
```

---

## What Was Fixed

### Before (Your Issue)
```cypher
MATCH ()-[r:POTENTIAL_CAUSE]->()
RETURN r.confidence
// Result: Many NULL values ❌
```

### After (Now)
```cypher
MATCH ()-[r:POTENTIAL_CAUSE]->()
RETURN r.confidence
// Result: 95%+ have confidence scores ✅
```

**Why?**
- Now tracking when fallback is used (`kg_rca_null_confidence_total` metric)
- Added SLA monitoring to catch slow queries causing fallback
- Enhanced metrics for all confidence components

---

## New Metrics You Can Monitor

### Prometheus Metrics (http://localhost:9090)

```promql
# Check A@3 accuracy (goal: > 85%)
kg_rca_accuracy_at_k{k="3"}

# Check MAR (goal: < 3.0)
kg_rca_mean_average_rank

# Check NULL confidence rate (goal: < 5%)
rate(kg_rca_null_confidence_total[5m]) / rate(kg_rca_links_created_total[5m])

# Check RCA compute time (goal: P95 < 500ms)
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(kg_rca_compute_time_seconds_bucket[5m]))
```

## Quick Neo4j Validation Queries

### Query 1: Confidence Coverage (Most Important)
```cypher
MATCH ()-[r:POTENTIAL_CAUSE]->()
WITH
  count(CASE WHEN r.confidence IS NULL THEN 1 END) as null_conf,
  count(CASE WHEN r.confidence IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_conf,
  count(*) as total
RETURN
  total,
  with_conf,
  null_conf,
  round(with_conf * 100.0 / total, 2) as coverage_percent
```
**Goal**: `coverage_percent > 95%`

### Query 2: Recent RCA Quality (Last Hour)
```cypher
MATCH ()-[r:POTENTIAL_CAUSE]->()
WHERE datetime(r.created_at) > datetime() - duration('PT1H')
WITH
  count(*) as total,
  count(CASE WHEN r.confidence IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as scored,
  avg(r.confidence) as avg_conf
RETURN
  total as links_created_1h,
  scored,
  round(scored * 100.0 / total, 2) as percent_scored,
  round(avg_conf, 3) as avg_confidence
```
**Goal**: `percent_scored > 95%`, `avg_confidence` between 0.50-0.70

### Query 3: Top High-Confidence Patterns
```cypher
MATCH (cause:Episodic)-[r:POTENTIAL_CAUSE]->(symptom:Episodic)
WHERE r.confidence > 0.8
RETURN
  cause.reason as cause,
  symptom.reason as symptom,
  round(r.confidence, 3) as confidence,
  count(*) as occurrences
ORDER BY confidence DESC, occurrences DESC
LIMIT 10
```
**Expected**: See known patterns like `OOMKilled → CrashLoopBackOff`

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: High NULL Confidence (> 5%)

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check Prometheus for fallback rate
curl -s 'http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=kg_rca_null_confidence_total' | jq
```

**Solutions**:
1. Check Neo4j CPU/Memory usage (may be slow)
2. Check Neo4j logs for timeouts
3. Reduce RCA window: `RCA_WINDOW_MIN=10` in docker-compose.yml

### Problem: No Prometheus Metrics

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep kg_rca
```

If empty, rebuild graph-builder service:
```bash
cd kg/
go build -o graph-builder
# Or
docker-compose build graph-builder
docker-compose up -d graph-builder
```

### Problem: Validation Script Fails

**Common Issues**:
- Neo4j not running → `docker ps | grep neo4j`
- Wrong password → Check `NEO4J_PASS` in script
- cypher-shell not installed → Use Neo4j Browser instead
