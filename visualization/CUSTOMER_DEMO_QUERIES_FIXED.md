## ⚠️ Key Differences from Original

1. **Confidence threshold lowered**: 0.7 → 0.4 (max confidence in DB is 0.56)
2. **Event reasons updated**: Using actual reasons like "LOG_ERROR", "FailedCreate", "KubePodCrashLooping"
3. **No OOMKilled events**: Using existing event types
4. **No USES_VOLUME relationships**: Queries removed or modified
5. **Namespace is NULL**: Namespace filtering removed
6. **Label casing fixed**: "StatefulSet" → "Statefulset", "PersistentVolumeClaim" → "Persistentvolumeclaim"

## 1. 📈 System Overview - Show Scale

### Query 1.1: System Health Snapshot (✅ WORKING)

```cypher
// Show total events, RCA links, and resource coverage
MATCH (e:Episodic)
WITH count(e) as total_events

MATCH (r:Resource)
WITH total_events, count(r) as total_resources, collect(DISTINCT labels(r)[1]) as resource_types

MATCH ()-[pc:POTENTIAL_CAUSE]->()
WITH total_events, total_resources, resource_types, count(pc) as rca_links

MATCH (e:Episodic)
WITH total_events, total_resources, resource_types, rca_links,
     collect(DISTINCT e.source) as sources,
     collect(DISTINCT e.reason) as event_types

RETURN
  total_events as `Total Events Processed`,
  rca_links as `RCA Links Generated`,
  total_resources as `Resources Tracked`,
  size([rt IN resource_types WHERE rt IS NOT NULL]) as `Resource Types`,
  size(event_types) as `Event Types Detected`,
  size(sources) as `Data Sources`,
  sources as `Source Systems`
```

### Query 1.2: Event Distribution by Severity (✅ WORKING)

```cypher
// Show severity breakdown with visual bar chart
MATCH (e:Episodic)
WITH e.severity as severity, count(*) as count
WITH severity, count, sum(count) as total
RETURN
  severity as `Severity Level`,
  count as `Event Count`,
  round(count * 100.0 / total, 2) as `Percentage`
ORDER BY
  CASE severity
    WHEN 'FATAL' THEN 1
    WHEN 'ERROR' THEN 2
    WHEN 'WARNING' THEN 3
    WHEN 'INFO' THEN 4
    ELSE 5
  END
```

---

## 2. 🔍 RCA Visualization - The Killer Feature

### Query 2.1: Recent RCA Chains (✅ WORKING - but needs data)

```cypher
// Show root cause chains for recent incidents
MATCH path = (symptom:Episodic)-[:POTENTIAL_CAUSE*1..3]->(cause:Episodic)
WHERE symptom.severity IN ['ERROR', 'FATAL']
  AND datetime(symptom.event_time) > datetime() - duration('PT24H')  // Extended to 24h
WITH path, length(path) as depth
ORDER BY depth DESC
LIMIT 20
RETURN path
```

**Note**: If no results, try removing the time filter or extending to `PT48H`

### Query 2.2: High-Confidence RCA Links (✅ FIXED - lowered threshold)

```cypher
// Show RCA links with confidence scores (FIXED: 0.7 → 0.4)
MATCH (cause:Episodic)-[r:POTENTIAL_CAUSE]->(symptom:Episodic)
WHERE r.confidence > 0.4  // CHANGED FROM 0.7 (max in DB is 0.56)
  AND symptom.severity IN ['ERROR', 'FATAL']
WITH
  cause, symptom, r,
  duration.inSeconds(datetime(cause.event_time), datetime(symptom.event_time)).seconds as time_gap
ORDER BY r.confidence DESC, time_gap ASC
LIMIT 15
RETURN
  datetime(cause.event_time).epochMillis as `Cause Time`,
  cause.reason as `Root Cause Event`,
  datetime(symptom.event_time).epochMillis as `Symptom Time`,
  symptom.reason as `Symptom Event`,
  time_gap as `Seconds Gap`,
  round(r.confidence, 3) as `Confidence`,
  round(r.temporal_score, 3) as `Time Score`,
  round(r.distance_score, 3) as `Topology Score`
```

### Query 2.3: RCA for CrashLoopBackOff (✅ FIXED - uses existing BackOff events)

```cypher
// Trace back a BackOff to root causes (FIXED: removed variable scope issue)
MATCH path = (symptom:Episodic {reason: 'BackOff'})-[:POTENTIAL_CAUSE*1..4]->(cause:Episodic)
WITH path,
     nodes(path) as chain,
     length(path) as hops,
     [n IN nodes(path) | n.reason] as event_sequence
ORDER BY hops DESC
LIMIT 1

UNWIND chain as node
WITH node
ORDER BY node.event_time
RETURN
  node.event_time as `Time`,
  node.reason as `Event`,
  node.severity as `Severity`,
  node.message as `Details`,
  node.source as `Source`
```

**Note**: Only 7 BackOff events exist. If no chains found, try:

```cypher
// Alternative: Show BackOff events directly
MATCH (e:Episodic {reason: 'BackOff'})
RETURN
  e.event_time as `Time`,
  e.reason as `Event`,
  e.severity as `Severity`,
  e.message as `Details`,
  e.source as `Source`
ORDER BY e.event_time DESC
```

### Query 2.4: LOG_ERROR RCA Chains (✅ NEW - uses most common event)

```cypher
// Show LOG_ERROR events and their root causes
MATCH path = (symptom:Episodic {reason: 'LOG_ERROR'})-[:POTENTIAL_CAUSE*1..3]->(cause:Episodic)
WITH path, length(path) as depth
ORDER BY depth DESC
LIMIT 20
RETURN path
```

## 3. 🗺️ Topology Mapping - Resource Relationships

### Query 3.1: Full Resource Topology (✅ FIXED - removed namespace filter)

```cypher
// Show complete K8s resource hierarchy (FIXED: namespace removed, all NULL)

OPTIONAL MATCH (p)-[:RUNS_ON]->(n:Node)
OPTIONAL MATCH (p)<-[:ABOUT]-(e:Episodic)
WHERE e.severity IN ['ERROR', 'FATAL']
WITH path, p, n, count(e) as error_count
RETURN path, n, error_count
LIMIT 50
```

### Query 3.2: StatefulSet Topology (❌ REMOVED - no USES_VOLUME relationships)

**Issue**: No USES_VOLUME relationships exist in the database. This needs to be implemented in the graph builder.

Alternative query showing StatefulSet without volumes:

```cypher
// Show StatefulSet with error tracking
MATCH (ss:Statefulset)-[:CONTROLS]->(p:Pod)
OPTIONAL MATCH (p)<-[:ABOUT]-(e:Episodic)
WHERE e.severity IN ['ERROR', 'FATAL']
WITH ss, p, count(e) as errors
RETURN ss, p, errors
LIMIT 30
```

### Query 3.3: Cross-Pod Impact Analysis (❌ REMOVED - no OOMKilled events)

**Issue**: No OOMKilled events exist. Alternative using FailedCreate:

```cypher
// Show how one pod's FailedCreate affects related pods
MATCH (failing_pod:Pod)<-[:ABOUT]-(e:Episodic {reason: 'FailedCreate'})
WITH failing_pod, e
LIMIT 1

MATCH (failing_pod)<-[:CONTROLS]-(rs:ReplicaSet)<-[:CONTROLS]-(d:Deployment)
MATCH (d)-[:CONTROLS]->(rs2:ReplicaSet)-[:CONTROLS]->(other_pod:Pod)
WHERE other_pod <> failing_pod
OPTIONAL MATCH (other_pod)<-[:ABOUT]-(impact:Episodic)
WHERE datetime(impact.event_time) > datetime(e.event_time)
  AND duration.inSeconds(datetime(e.event_time), datetime(impact.event_time)).seconds < 300

WITH failing_pod, e, other_pod, collect(impact) as impacts
RETURN
  failing_pod.name as `Failed Pod`,
  other_pod.name as `Potentially Affected Pod`,
  size(impacts) as `Subsequent Errors`,
  [i IN impacts | i.reason][0..3] as `Impact Events`
```

  AND (related = r OR
       EXISTS((related)-[:CONTROLS|RUNS_ON*1..3]-(r)))
WITH start, e, related
ORDER BY e.event_time
RETURN
  e.event_time as `Time`,
  duration.inSeconds(datetime(start.event_time), datetime(e.event_time)).seconds as `Seconds After Trigger`,
  e.severity as `Severity`,
  e.reason as `Event`,
  related.name as `Resource`,
  labels(related)[1] as `Type`
```

### Query 4.3: Hourly Event Rate (✅ WORKING)

```cypher
// Show event volume by hour to detect spikes
MATCH (e:Episodic)
WHERE datetime(e.event_time) > datetime() - duration('P1D')
WITH
  datetime(e.event_time).hour as hour,
  e.severity as severity,
  count(*) as count
WITH hour, severity, count
ORDER BY hour
RETURN
  hour as `Hour of Day`,
  sum(count) as `Total Events`,
  sum(CASE WHEN severity = 'ERROR' THEN count ELSE 0 END) as `Errors`,
  sum(CASE WHEN severity = 'FATAL' THEN count ELSE 0 END) as `Fatal`,

WHERE datetime(k8s.event_time) BETWEEN datetime(prom.event_time) - duration('PT5M')
                                   AND datetime(prom.event_time) + duration('PT5M')

## 🔧 Data Issues to Fix

### Critical Issues:

1. **Low Confidence Scores**: Max is 0.56, should be > 0.7 for high confidence RCA
   - **Fix**: Review confidence scoring algorithm in [kg/anomaly.go](kg/anomaly.go)

2. **Missing namespace Property**: All Deployment.namespace are NULL
   - **Fix**: Update graph builder to populate namespace field

3. **No USES_VOLUME Relationships**: StatefulSet volume queries don't work
   - **Fix**: Implement USES_VOLUME relationship creation in graph builder

4. **Limited Event Types**: No OOMKilled, only 7 BackOff events
   - **Fix**: Ensure all K8s event types are being ingested

5. **No BackOff RCA Chains**: BackOff events have no POTENTIAL_CAUSE links
   - **Fix**: Investigate why BackOff events aren't being analyzed for RCA

### To Check:

```cypher
// Check confidence score distribution
MATCH ()-[r:POTENTIAL_CAUSE]->()
RETURN
  min(r.confidence) as min,
  max(r.confidence) as max,
  avg(r.confidence) as avg,
  percentileCont(r.confidence, 0.5) as median,
  percentileCont(r.confidence, 0.9) as p90,
  percentileCont(r.confidence, 0.99) as p99
```
