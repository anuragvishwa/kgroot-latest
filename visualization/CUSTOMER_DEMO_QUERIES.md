## 1. 📈 System Overview - Show Scale

### Query 1.1: System Health Snapshot

```cypher
// Show total events, RCA links, and resource coverage
MATCH (e:Episodic)
WITH count(e) as total_events

MATCH (r:Resource)
WITH total_events, count(r) as total_resources, collect(DISTINCT labels(r)[0]) as resource_types

MATCH ()-[pc:POTENTIAL_CAUSE]->()
WITH total_events, total_resources, resource_types, count(pc) as rca_links

MATCH (e:Episodic)
WITH total_events, total_resources, resource_types, rca_links,
     collect(DISTINCT e.source) as sources,
     collect(DISTINCT e.reason) as event_types

RETURN
  total_events as `Total Events Processed`,
  rca_links as `RCA Links Generated`,
  total_resources as `Resources Tracked`,
  size(resource_types) as `Resource Types`,
  size(event_types) as `Event Types Detected`,
  size(sources) as `Data Sources`,
  sources as `Source Systems`
```

**What to say**: "Our system has processed over [X] events from [Y] sources, generating [Z] root cause analysis links across [W] Kubernetes resources in real-time."

### Query 1.2: Event Distribution by Severity

```cypher
// Show severity breakdown with visual bar chart
MATCH (e:Episodic)
WITH e.severity as severity, count(*) as count
WITH severity, count, sum(count) as total
RETURN
  severity as `Severity Level`,
  count as `Event Count`,
  round(count * 100.0 / total, 2) as `Percentage`
ORDER BY
  CASE severity
    WHEN 'FATAL' THEN 1
    WHEN 'ERROR' THEN 2
    WHEN 'WARNING' THEN 3
    WHEN 'INFO' THEN 4
    ELSE 5
  END
```

**What to say**: "We automatically classify events by severity, allowing teams to prioritize critical issues first."

---

## 2. 🔍 RCA Visualization - The Killer Feature

### Query 2.1: Recent RCA Chains (Interactive Graph)

```cypher
// Show root cause chains for recent incidents
MATCH path = (symptom:Episodic)-[:POTENTIAL_CAUSE*1..3]->(cause:Episodic)
WHERE symptom.severity IN ['ERROR', 'FATAL']
  AND datetime(symptom.event_time) > datetime() - duration('PT6H')
WITH path, length(path) as depth
ORDER BY depth DESC
LIMIT 20
RETURN path
```

**What to say**: "Here you see how our system automatically traces errors back to their root causes. Red nodes are symptoms, and the graph shows the chain of causality."

**Demo tip**: Click on nodes to show properties (event_time, reason, message). Highlight how the graph shows temporal flow.

### Query 2.2: High-Confidence RCA Links

```cypher
// Show RCA links with confidence scores
MATCH (cause:Episodic)-[r:POTENTIAL_CAUSE]->(symptom:Episodic)
WHERE r.confidence > 0.7
  AND symptom.severity IN ['ERROR', 'FATAL']
WITH
  cause, symptom, r,
  duration.inSeconds(datetime(cause.event_time), datetime(symptom.event_time)).seconds as time_gap
ORDER BY r.confidence DESC, time_gap ASC
LIMIT 15
RETURN
  datetime(cause.event_time).epochMillis as `Cause Time`,
  cause.reason as `Root Cause Event`,
  datetime(symptom.event_time).epochMillis as `Symptom Time`,
  symptom.reason as `Symptom Event`,
  time_gap as `Seconds Gap`,
  round(r.confidence, 3) as `Confidence`,
  round(r.temporal_score, 3) as `Time Score`,
  round(r.distance_score, 3) as `Topology Score`
```

**What to say**: "Our confidence scoring combines temporal proximity, topology distance, and domain knowledge. High confidence means 'investigate this first'."

### Query 2.3: RCA for Specific Incident (CrashLoopBackOff)

```cypher
// Trace back a CrashLoopBackOff to root causes
MATCH path = (symptom:Episodic {reason: 'BackOff'})-[:POTENTIAL_CAUSE*1..4]->(cause:Episodic)
WITH path,
     nodes(path) as chain,
     length(path) as hops,
     [n IN nodes(path) | n.reason] as event_sequence
ORDER BY hops DESC
LIMIT 1

UNWIND chain as node
RETURN
  node.event_time as `Time`,
  node.reason as `Event`,
  node.severity as `Severity`,
  node.message as `Details`,
  node.source as `Source`
ORDER BY node.event_time
```

**What to say**: "When pods crash repeatedly, our system traces back through the chain of events to find the original failure - whether it's OOM, config errors, or dependency failures."

---

## 3. 🗺️ Topology Mapping - Resource Relationships

### Query 3.1: Full Resource Topology (Visual Graph)

```cypher
// Show complete K8s resource hierarchy
MATCH path = (d:Deployment)-[:CONTROLS]->(rs:ReplicaSet)-[:CONTROLS]->(p:Pod)

WHERE e.severity IN ['ERROR', 'FATAL']
WITH path, p, n, count(e) as error_count
RETURN path, n, error_count
LIMIT 50
```

**Demo tip**: Show how pods with errors are highlighted differently. Click on nodes to show resource details.

### Query 3.2: StatefulSet Topology with Storage

```cypher
// Show StatefulSet with PersistentVolumeClaims
MATCH path = (ss:StatefulSet)-[:CONTROLS]->(p:Pod)-[:USES_VOLUME]->(pvc:PersistentVolumeClaim)
OPTIONAL MATCH (p)<-[:ABOUT]-(e:Episodic)
WHERE e.severity IN ['ERROR', 'FATAL']
WITH path, ss, p, pvc, count(e) as errors
RETURN path, errors
LIMIT 30
```

**What to say**: "For stateful applications, we track storage dependencies too. This helps identify if failures are due to disk issues."

WITH failing_pod, other_pod, collect(impact) as impacts
RETURN
  failing_pod.name as `Failed Pod`,
  other_pod.name as `Potentially Affected Pod`,
  size(impacts) as `Subsequent Errors`,
  [i IN impacts | i.reason][0..3] as `Impact Events`
```

  e.severity as `Severity`,
  e.reason as `Event`,
  related.name as `Resource`,
  labels(related)[0] as `Type`
```

**What to say**: "Here's a cascading failure in action - one error triggers multiple related events within minutes. Our RCA automatically groups these."

### Query 4.3: Hourly Event Rate (Trend Detection)

```cypher
// Show event volume by hour to detect spikes
MATCH (e:Episodic)
WHERE datetime(e.event_time) > datetime() - duration('P1D')

### Query 5.2: Alert → Event Correlation

```cypher
// Show how Prometheus alerts correlate with K8s events
MATCH (prom:Episodic {source: 'prom.alert', reason: 'KubePodCrashLooping'})-[:ABOUT]->(pod:Pod)

**Demo tip**: This creates a dense, impressive-looking graph. Use Neo4j Browser's physics simulation to make it look organic and alive.

---

## 🎯 Demo Tips

### Before the Demo:
1. **Generate some test events** - Run test scenarios from `test-scenarios/` folder
2. **Set time windows appropriately** - Adjust `PT1H`, `PT6H`, `P1D` based on your data
3. **Pick the right namespace** - Replace `kg-testing` with customer-relevant namespace
4. **Pre-run queries** - Test all queries beforehand to ensure data exists

### During the Demo:
1. **Start with overview** - Show scale and coverage first
2. **Focus on RCA** - This is your differentiator
3. **Make it interactive** - Click on nodes, show properties
4. **Tell a story** - "Here's a recent incident, let me show how we traced it..."
5. **Show value** - "Without this, engineers would need to check logs, metrics, events separately"

### Customization Points:
- Change `datetime() - duration('PT1H')` to match demo data freshness
- Replace `'kg-testing'` namespace with customer namespace
- Adjust `LIMIT` values based on graph density
- Filter by specific `reason` or `severity` to focus demo

### Neo4j Browser Settings:
- **Graph Style**: Click any node → Click paintbrush icon → Customize colors
- **Layout**: Use physics simulation for organic look
- **Labels**: Show/hide properties by clicking node types in left panel
- **Export**: Can export visualizations as PNG/SVG for presentations
