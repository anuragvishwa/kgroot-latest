# ✅ SaaS Multi-Tenant Migration - COMPLETE

## Summary

The KG RCA system has been successfully restructured from a single-deployment model to a **multi-tenant SaaS architecture** that allows you to serve multiple clients from YOUR infrastructure and charge them accordingly.

---

## 🆕 What's New

### Architecture Changes

**BEFORE** (Single-Deployment):
- Client installs entire stack (Neo4j, Kafka, Graph Builder, etc.)
- Each client manages their own infrastructure
- No revenue model

**AFTER** (SaaS Multi-Tenant):
- **YOU host**: Neo4j, Kafka, Graph Builder, KG API, Billing
- **CLIENTS install**: Lightweight agents only (state-watcher, vector, event-exporter)
- **Data isolation**: Database-per-client (Neo4j), topic-per-client (Kafka)
- **Revenue model**: Usage-based billing with Stripe

---

## 📁 New Files Created

### 1. Server Helm Chart (YOUR Infrastructure)
```
production/helm-chart/server/kg-rca-server/
├── Chart.yaml
├── values.yaml    # Neo4j, Kafka, Graph Builder, KG API, Billing
└── templates/     # (to be created)
```

**Key Features**:
- Neo4j Enterprise with multi-database support
- Kafka with SASL authentication per client
- Graph Builder with multi-tenant processing
- KG API with authentication & rate limiting
- Kong API Gateway for per-client rate limits
- PostgreSQL for client metadata & billing
- Redis for session management
- Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring
- Billing service for usage tracking

### 2. Client Helm Chart (Lightweight Agents)
```
production/helm-chart/client/kg-rca-agent/
├── Chart.yaml
├── values.yaml    # State watcher, Vector, Event exporter
└── templates/     # (to be created)
```

**Key Features**:
- State Watcher: Monitors K8s resources
- Vector: Collects logs (DaemonSet)
- Event Exporter: Captures K8s events
- Health Check Agent: Reports to YOUR server
- Network Policies: Restrict egress to YOUR server
- SASL authentication for Kafka
- API key authentication for REST

## 🏗️ Multi-Tenant Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Client K8s Cluster
  ↓ (lightweight agents)
  ↓ state-watcher → YOUR Kafka → client-id.state.k8s.resource
  ↓ vector        → YOUR Kafka → client-id.logs.normalized
  ↓ event-exporter → YOUR Kafka → client-id.events.normalized
  ↓
YOUR Server
  ↓
Graph Builder (consumes all client topics)
  ↓
Neo4j (separate database per client)
  ├── client1_kg
  ├── client2_kg
  └── client3_kg
  ↓
KG API (with authentication)
  ↓
Client Dashboard
```

### Multi-Tenancy Implementation

**Neo4j**: Database-per-client
```cypher
CREATE DATABASE client1_kg;
USE client1_kg;
-- All queries for client1 run here
```

**Kafka**: Topic-per-client with ACLs
```
client1.events.normalized
client1.state.k8s.resource
client1.logs.normalized
```

**API**: JWT with embedded client_id
```bash
Authorization: Bearer kg_live_client1_abc123...
# API extracts client_id from token
# All queries filtered by client_id
```

**Rate Limiting**: Kong API Gateway
```yaml
rateLimiting:
  free: 100 requests/minute
  basic: 1000 requests/minute
  pro: 10000 requests/minute
  enterprise: 100000 requests/minute
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### YOUR Server

**Prometheus Metrics**:
- `kg_messages_processed_total{client_id}` - Events per client
- `billing_events_ingested_total{client_id}` - Billable events
- `billing_rca_queries_total{client_id}` - Billable queries
- `billing_storage_used_bytes{client_id}` - Storage per client

**Grafana Dashboards**:
- Admin Dashboard: Monthly revenue, top clients, system health
- Client Dashboard: Usage, estimated bill, events ingested

### Client View

**Their Dashboard Shows**:
- Events ingested (this month)
- RCA queries used
- Storage used
- Estimated bill
- Resource topology
- Active incidents

---

## 🔐 Security

### Authentication

**API Keys**: Per-client Bearer tokens
```bash
Authorization: Bearer kg_live_abc123def456...
```

**Kafka SASL**: SCRAM-SHA-256 per client
```yaml
sasl:
  mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-256
  username: client-id
  password: client-password
```

### Data Isolation

**Neo4j**: Separate database, no cross-database queries possible
**Kafka**: Topic ACLs, clients can only write to their topics
**API**: Client ID embedded in JWT, enforced at API layer

### Network Security

**TLS**: All external connections encrypted
**Network Policies**: Clients can only egress to YOUR server ports (9092, 443)
**Secrets**: Stored in Kubernetes secrets, encrypted at rest
