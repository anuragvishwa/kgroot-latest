Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s incident response

Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! Quick question:

How much time does your team spend finding root causes
during K8s incidents?

I've built a tool that automatically identifies root
causes using knowledge graphs (94% accuracy, 70% MTTR
reduction in pilots).

Would a 10-min demo make sense? No strings attached,
just curious if it could help your team.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. Here's the technical paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13264

## Questions?

Common concerns:

**"What if I can't find customers?"**
â†’ You need to talk to 100 people to find 10 interested, to get 1 customer.
  Start with warm contacts, then go cold.

**"What if they don't pay upfront?"**
â†’ Offer invoice with Net 7 (not Net 30). If they can't pay within a week,
  they're not serious.

**"What if I can't deliver?"**
â†’ You already have the product working! Just need to provision
  infrastructure and help them install. That's the $500.

**"What if it doesn't work for them?"**
â†’ That's why you have 50% refund guarantee. Worst case, you refund $250,
  keep $250 for your time, and learn from the experience.

---

## Remember:

1. **Price is not the objection** - if they have the problem, $500 is nothing
2. **You're solving a real problem** - MTTR costs companies thousands per month
3. **You have proof** - 94% accuracy, 70% MTTR reduction from pilots
4. **The product works** - it's deployed and running on AWS
5. **You just need 1 customer** - to prove the model and get cash flow

**Go get your first customer!** ðŸš€
