## Key Features

### 1. **Complete Stack in One File**
The `docker-compose.yml` includes:
- Kafka + Zookeeper (event streaming)
- Neo4j (knowledge graph database)
- Graph Builder (KG construction engine)
- Alerts Enricher (alert processing)
- KG API (REST API for clients)
- Prometheus (metrics collection)
- Grafana (visualization)
- Nginx (reverse proxy + SSL)
- Certbot (SSL certificate management)

### 2. **Automated Deployment**
- **Terraform**: One-command infrastructure setup
- **setup.sh**: Installs Docker, creates directories, configures services
- **Auto-generated passwords**: Secure by default

### 3. **Production-Ready**
- ✅ SSL/TLS with Let's Encrypt
- ✅ Health checks for all services
- ✅ Automatic restart on failure
- ✅ Daily backup script
- ✅ Systemd integration (auto-start on boot)
- ✅ Proper volume management

### 4. **Cost-Effective**
- **t3.large**: $77/month (5 clients)
- **t3.xlarge**: $137/month (10 clients)
- **3-6x cheaper than K8s** for small deployments

### 5. **Easy Operations**
```bash
./health-check.sh    # Check all services
./backup.sh          # Backup Neo4j data
docker-compose logs  # View logs
docker-compose restart <service>  # Restart service
```

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Terraform (Recommended)
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
# Follow terraform output for next steps
```

**Result:** Fully configured EC2 instance with storage, networking, and security groups

### Option 2: Manual
1. Launch EC2 via AWS Console
2. SSH and run `./setup.sh`
3. Configure `.env`
4. Start with `docker-compose up -d`

## What Makes This Different

### vs. Kubernetes Deployment
| Feature | EC2 (server_mini) | K8s (server) |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| Setup Time | 30 minutes | 2-3 hours |
| Cost | $77/month | $216/month |
| Complexity | Low | High |
| Maintenance | Simple | Complex |
| Scalability | Manual (vertical) | Auto (horizontal) |
| Best For | MVP, 5-10 clients | Production, 50+ clients |

### vs. Local Docker Compose
- ✅ Production-grade (not just dev)
- ✅ SSL/TLS certificates
- ✅ Public internet access
- ✅ Backup/restore procedures
- ✅ Monitoring built-in
- ✅ Cloud infrastructure

## Use Cases

### Perfect For:
- ✅ MVP deployments
- ✅ Pilot programs with 5-10 clients
- ✅ Budget-conscious projects
- ✅ Teams without K8s expertise
- ✅ Development/staging environments

### Not Ideal For:
- ❌ 20+ clients (use K8s)
- ❌ Mission-critical 99.99% uptime (use K8s)
- ❌ Multi-region deployments (use K8s)
- ❌ Complex compliance requirements (use K8s)

## Migration Path

When you outgrow EC2:

1. **Backup**: `./backup.sh`
2. **Setup K8s**: Use `../server/` deployment
3. **Restore data**: Load Neo4j backup in K8s
4. **Update DNS**: Point to K8s load balancer
5. **Decommission EC2**

**Timeline**: 1-2 days with testing

## Quick Facts

- ⏱️ **Setup Time**: 30 minutes
- 💰 **Monthly Cost**: $77 (t3.large) or $137 (t3.xlarge)

- 📈 **Uptime**: ~99.5% (single AZ)
- 🔧 **Maintenance**: < 1 hour/week
- 📚 **Documentation**: 4 comprehensive guides
- 🎓 **Learning Curve**: Low (Docker knowledge helpful)

## Success Criteria

This deployment is successful if:

1. ✅ All services start healthy
2. ✅ SSL certificate installed
3. ✅ Client can connect via HTTPS
4. ✅ Events flow through Kafka
5. ✅ Neo4j graph builds correctly
6. ✅ RCA queries return results
7. ✅ Monitoring accessible via tunnel
8. ✅ Backups run automatically

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test the deployment**
   - Run health-check.sh
   - Test API endpoint
   - Check all services are up

2. **Onboard first client**
