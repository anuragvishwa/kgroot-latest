## Cost Structure

### Per-Customer Costs (EC2 Deployment)

**Infrastructure:**
```
EC2 instance (shared):  $7.70/month per customer (on t3.large)
EBS storage:            $0.80/month per customer (10GB)
Data transfer:          $0.90/month per customer (assume 1GB/day)
Stripe fees:            $3.17/month (3.2% of $99)
                        ─────────────────────────
Total cost per customer: $12.57/month

Your profit per customer: $99 - $12.57 = $86.43/month (87% margin!)
```

**Note:** One t3.large ($77/month) can handle ~10 customers before you need to upgrade.

### Scaling Costs

| Customers | Instance Type | Monthly Cost | Revenue ($99/ea) | Profit | Margin |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------------|--------|--------|
| 1-10 | t3.large ($77) | $77 + ($13×N) | $99N | High | 87% |
| 11-20 | t3.xlarge ($137) | $137 + ($13×N) | $99N | High | 85% |
| 21-50 | t3.2xlarge ($250) | $250 + ($13×N) | $99N | High | 83% |
| 51+ | Move to K8s | ~$500 base | $99N | High | 90%+ |

**Key insight:** Your margins IMPROVE as you scale!

## Break-Even Analysis

### How Many Customers to Cover Personal Expenses?

Assume you need $5,000/month to live:

```
Profit per customer: $86.43/month
Customers needed: $5,000 / $86.43 = 58 customers

BUT with setup fees:
5 customers/month × $500 = $2,500
10 customers × $99 = $990/month
Total: $3,490/month

You can live on 10-15 customers!
```

---

## Pricing Psychology

### Why $500 Setup Fee Works

1. **Filters tire-kickers:** Only serious companies pay upfront
2. **Covers AWS costs:** $500 pays for 6+ months of their infrastructure
3. **Anchoring:** Makes $99/month feel cheap (vs. $499 normal price)
4. **Commitment:** They're invested, so they'll actually use it

### Why $99/Month is Perfect

1. **Below budget threshold:** Most teams can expense <$100 without approval
2. **Feels affordable:** Less than one hour of SRE time
3. **High perceived value:** They save 20+ hours/month
4. **Massive margin:** You profit $86/month per customer

### Price Increases Over Time

| Phase | Price | Reason |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Alpha (first 5)** | $500 + $99/mo | Get traction, prove product |
| **Beta (next 15)** | $500 + $149/mo | Validated, add features |
| **Launch (next 50)** | $0 + $199/mo | Scale, remove setup friction |
| **Growth (next 500)** | $0 + $299/mo | Premium positioning |
| **Mature** | $99-$2000/mo | Multiple tiers, enterprise |

**Early customers get locked-in rates** (great incentive to join now!)

## Payment Terms That Work

### For Startups/SMBs (DO THIS)
```
✅ Pay via Stripe (instant)
✅ $500 setup + $99/month (auto-renew)
✅ 3-month minimum commitment
✅ Credit card required
```

### For Enterprises (ONLY if >$2k/month)
```
✅ Invoice with Net 15 (not Net 30!)
✅ 50% upfront, 50% after POC
✅ Annual contract (12 months minimum)
✅ Wire transfer or ACH
```

### What NOT to Do
```
❌ Free trials (you can't afford AWS costs)
❌ Net 30/60 terms (you need cash now)
❌ "Pay if you like it" (they never will)
❌ Month-to-month with no commitment (churn nightmare)
```

## Refund Policy

### Money-Back Guarantee (Builds Trust)

```
If you don't see 50% MTTR improvement within 30 days,
we'll refund 50% of your setup fee ($250).

Terms:
- You must run it for full 30 days
- Minimum 5 incidents during period
- You provide before/after MTTR data
- Refund only on setup fee (not monthly)
```

**Why 50% (not 100%)?**
- Covers your AWS costs if they churn
- Shows you're confident but fair
- Reduces refund abuse

**Expected refund rate:** <5% if you qualify customers properly

---

## Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

### Average Customer

```
Setup fee:           $500 (one-time)
Monthly:             $99/month
Average lifespan:    18 months (conservative)
Stripe fees:         -$64 total

LTV = $500 + ($99 × 18) - $64 = $2,218
Cost per customer = $13/month × 18 = $234
Net LTV = $1,984
```

### Best Case (Upgrade to Pro)

```
Setup fee:           $500
Months 1-6 @ $99:    $594
Months 7+ @ $499:    $5,988 (12 months)
Lifespan:            18 months

LTV = $7,082
Net LTV = $6,600+
```

### How to Increase LTV

1. **Reduce churn:** Great support, regular check-ins
2. **Upsell:** Basic → Pro after 6 months
3. **Annual plans:** 20% discount for annual prepay
4. **Add-ons:** Extra events, dedicated support
5. **Multi-cluster:** Charge per cluster

## Alternative Pricing Models

### If You Can't Get Upfront Payment

**Option 1: First Month Prepaid**
```
$299 first month (includes setup)
$99/month thereafter
3-month minimum = $597 total
```

**Option 2: Split Setup Fee**
```
$250 now + $250 after 30 days
$99/month starts month 2
```

**Option 3: Higher Monthly, No Setup**
```
$0 setup
$199/month
6-month minimum = $1,194 total
```

**Goal:** Get SOME money upfront to cover AWS

### Startup (10-50 employees)
- **Pain:** Manual incident response, small team
- **Budget:** <$500/month
- **Price:** $500 + $99/month
- **Value:** Saves 10+ hours/month for 2-person SRE team

- **Price:** Custom ($2,000-10,000/month)
- **Value:** Saves 100+ hours/month for 20-person SRE org

**Start with startups/mid-market** - they decide fast!

## When to Raise Prices

### Signals It's Time to Increase Prices

1. **>80% close rate** on demos → You're too cheap
2. **No price objections** → You're too cheap
3. **Wait list forming** → Supply < demand
4. **You add major features** → More value = higher price
5. **Competitors charging more** → Market validation

### How to Raise Prices

```
Old customers: Keep at $99/month (loyalty)
New customers: $149/month (new standard)
Announce: "Price increasing to $149 next month, lock in $99 now!"
```

**Grandfathering old customers builds loyalty and creates urgency for new ones.**

## Competitor Pricing (For Context)

| Competitor | Pricing | Focus |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Datadog | $15/host/month | General observability |
| New Relic | $99/user/month | APM + observability |
| PagerDuty | $21-41/user/month | Incident management |
| OpsLevel | $25/user/month | Service catalog |
| Cortex | Custom | Internal dev portal |

**Your advantage:**
- Specific to RCA (not general monitoring)
- Usage-based (events) not seat-based
- Automated (no manual work required)

**Position as:** "Specialized RCA tool" not "general monitoring platform"

---

## Quick Decision Framework

### Should I Give a Discount?

Ask yourself:
1. Are they a **design partner**? (Give feedback, case study) → Yes, 50% off
2. Are they a **logo customer**? (Big brand, great for marketing) → Yes, 25% off
3. Are they **budget constrained**? → No, offer payment plan
4. Are they **price shopping**? → No, they're not your customer

**Never discount more than 50%** (cheapens your brand)

## Summary: The Money Math

```
Customer pays:        $500 setup + $99/month
Your AWS cost:        $77/month (10 customers on 1 instance)
Your cost per customer: $7.70/month + $3.17 Stripe = $10.87/month
Your profit:          $86.43/month per customer (87% margin!)

1 customer  = $1,037/year profit
10 customers = $10,370/year profit (+ $5,000 in setup fees)
20 customers = $20,740/year profit (covers 1 salary!)
50 customers = $51,850/year profit (hire 2 people!)
```

**The business model works.** You just need to find customers! 🚀

## Questions?

**"Why not charge more?"**
→ You want volume now. Raise prices later when proven.

**"Why not free tier?"**
→ You can't afford AWS costs. Maybe add free tier at 100 customers.

**"What if they negotiate?"**
→ Hold firm on price, but offer payment plans or longer terms.

**"Should I do annual contracts?"**
→ After you have 10+ customers. For now, focus on closing anyone.

**Next step:** Set up Stripe and send your first payment link!
