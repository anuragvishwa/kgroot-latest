# Freemium Model - Try Before You Buy

## The Problem You Identified
✅ **You're right:** No one pays $500 without seeing value first
✅ **The solution:** Free trial with hard limits that force upgrade

---

## 🎯 Recommended Model: Free Trial with Auto-Upgrade

### **Free Tier (Trial)**
```
Duration: 14 days OR 10,000 events (whichever comes first)
What they get:
  ✅ Full product access
  ✅ Real-time RCA
  ✅ Knowledge graph
  ✅ Up to 10,000 events
  ✅ Email support (48h response)

After 14 days or 10,000 events:
  → Account automatically pauses
  → Must upgrade to paid to continue
  → Data retained for 7 days
```

### **Paid Tier**
```
Price: $99/month (no setup fee!)
What they get:
  ✅ Unlimited events
  ✅ Unlimited duration
  ✅ Data retention: 90 days
  ✅ Email support (24h response)
  ✅ API access

Billing: Credit card required at signup, charged after trial
```

### **Your Protection**
```
Cost per free trial user: $0.50-$2 (14 days of AWS shared instance)
Conversion rate needed: 10% (1 in 10 trials convert)
Risk: $2 × 90 trials = $180 to get 10 paying customers ($990/mo revenue)
```

---

## 💡 Alternative Models (Ranked by Feasibility)

### **Option 1: Time-Limited Trial (RECOMMENDED)**

**Free Trial:**
- 14-day full access
- Unlimited events during trial
- Credit card required upfront (not charged until day 15)
- Auto-converts to paid on day 15

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Low friction (just need email + card)
- ✅ High conversion (forgot to cancel = you get paid)
- ✅ Time-limited = predictable costs
- ✅ Standard SaaS model (everyone does this)

**Your AWS Cost:**
- $77/month ÷ 30 days × 14 days = $36 per trial customer
- If 10 people trial simultaneously: $360 cost
- Need 4 conversions to break even (40% conversion rate)

**How to reduce cost:**
- Share one EC2 instance across all trial users
- Clean up trial data after 14 days
- Only provision dedicated infrastructure after payment

---

### **Option 2: Event-Limited Trial (BEST for your situation)**

**Free Tier:**
```
Events: 10,000 events (lifetime)
Duration: 30 days max
What happens at 10,000:
  → RCA stops processing new events
  → Graph becomes read-only
  → Email: "You've used 10,000/10,000 events. Upgrade to continue."
```

**Paid Tier:**
```
$0/month for first 100K events
$99/month for up to 1M events
$299/month for up to 10M events
```

**Why this is BEST:**
- ✅ **Predictable costs:** You know max AWS cost per free user
- ✅ **Qualifying mechanism:** High-volume users auto-qualify themselves
- ✅ **Fair pricing:** They pay for what they use
- ✅ **Easy to explain:** "First 10K events free, then $99/mo"

**Your AWS Cost:**
- 10,000 events ≈ 10MB data
- Storage: $0.001
- Compute: Shared instance = $0.50
- **Total cost per free user: $0.50**

**Math:**
- 100 free signups × $0.50 = $50 cost
- 10% convert (10 customers) × $99 = $990/month
- **ROI: $990 for $50 investment = 1,980% return!**

---

### **Option 3: Feature-Limited Free Tier**

**Free Forever:**
```
Events: 1,000 events/month (recurring)
Data retention: 7 days
Features: Basic RCA only (no advanced queries)
Support: Community (Discord/Slack)
```

**Paid Tier:**
```
$99/month:
  Events: Up to 1M/month
  Data retention: 90 days
  Features: Full RCA + custom queries
  Support: Email (24h)
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Low acquisition cost (free users stay forever)
- ✅ Build community
- ✅ Word of mouth

**Disadvantages:**
- ⚠️ Ongoing AWS costs for free users
- ⚠️ Lower conversion rates (they stay on free)

---

### **Option 4: Credit-Based System**

**Free Credits:**
```
Signup: 10,000 credits (free)
1 event processed = 1 credit
Average usage: 1,000 events/day = 10 days of usage
```

**Buy More Credits:**
```
$49: 50,000 credits (50% more vs monthly)
$99: 150,000 credits (150% more vs monthly)
$299: 500,000 credits (500% more vs monthly)

Or:
$99/month: Unlimited credits
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Psychological: "Free credits!" feels generous
- ✅ Flexibility: They control when to pay
- ✅ Upsell: Can buy small amounts first

**Disadvantages:**
- ⚠️ Complex to explain
- ⚠️ Harder to predict revenue

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **How to Enforce Limits**

#### **1. Event Counter (Simple)**

```javascript
// In your kg-builder or API service

async function processEvent(clientId, event) {
  // Check event count
  const usage = await db.getUsage(clientId);

  if (usage.plan === 'free' && usage.eventCount >= 10000) {
    // Hit limit!
    await sendUpgradeEmail(clientId);
    return { error: 'FREE_LIMIT_REACHED', message: 'Upgrade to continue' };
  }

  // Process event
  await buildKnowledgeGraph(event);

  // Increment counter
  await db.incrementEventCount(clientId);
}
```

#### **2. Time-Based Expiry**

```javascript
async function checkAccess(clientId) {
  const customer = await db.getCustomer(clientId);

  if (customer.plan === 'free') {
    const trialStarted = new Date(customer.createdAt);
    const daysSinceStart = (Date.now() - trialStarted) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);

    if (daysSinceStart > 14) {
      return { access: false, reason: 'TRIAL_EXPIRED' };
    }
  }

  return { access: true };
}
```

#### **3. Database Schema**

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  plan VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'free', -- 'free', 'paid'
  event_count INT DEFAULT 0,
  event_limit INT DEFAULT 10000,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  trial_ends_at TIMESTAMP,
  stripe_customer_id VARCHAR(255),
  stripe_subscription_id VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_plan ON customers(plan);
CREATE INDEX idx_trial_ends ON customers(trial_ends_at);
```

#### **4. Kafka Topic Routing**

```yaml
# Only paid customers get full processing
# Free customers share a single Neo4j database (multi-tenant)

Free customer:
  kafka topic: events.free-tier
  neo4j database: kg-free-tier (shared)
  retention: 7 days
  max events: 10,000

Paid customer:
  kafka topic: events.client-{id}
  neo4j database: kg-{client-id} (dedicated)
  retention: 90 days
  max events: unlimited
```

```
After 100 events processed:

Email: "Your first RCA is ready!"

- Screenshot of their knowledge graph
- "We found 3 potential root causes for your alerts"
- "Here's how much time you'll save: [calculation]"

Call to action: "See your full RCA dashboard"
```

#### **2. Usage Alerts**

```
At 5,000 events (50%):
"You're halfway through your free trial!
 Loving it? Upgrade now and never lose access."

At 8,000 events (80%):

"⚠️ 500 events remaining.

```

---

## 💡 Cost Management Strategies

### **How to Keep Free Tier Costs Low**

#### **1. Shared Infrastructure**

```
All free-tier users share:
- 1 Neo4j database (multi-tenant)
- 1 Kafka topic (partitioned by client)
- 1 EC2 instance (t3.large)

Cost: $77/month supports 50+ free trial users
Per-user cost: $1.54/month
```

#### **2. Aggressive Cleanup**

```
Free tier data retention:
- After 7 days: Delete old events
- After 30 days: Archive knowledge graph
- After 60 days: Purge completely

Saves storage costs: $0.10/GB/month
```

#### **3. Rate Limiting**

```
Free tier limits:
- Max 100 events/minute
- Max 1,000 events/day
- Max 10,000 events total

Prevents abuse and runaway AWS costs
```

#### **4. Regional Restrictions**

```
Free tier: Single region (us-east-1)
Paid tier: Choose any region

Saves cross-region data transfer costs
```
