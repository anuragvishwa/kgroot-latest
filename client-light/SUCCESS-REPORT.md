## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Kafka Server Configuration ✅
**Problem:** Kafka was advertising internal hostname `kafka:9092`
**Solution:** Updated `advertised.listeners` to public IP `98.90.147.12:9092`

```bash
# On mini-server
sed -i 's|KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS:.*|KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://98.90.147.12:9092|' \
  /home/ubuntu/kgroot-latest/mini-server-prod/docker-compose.yml

docker compose up -d --force-recreate kafka
```

### 2. Alert-Receiver Configuration ✅
**Problem:** Missing environment variables
**Solution:** Added all required Kafka topic configs

**Fixed in:** `client-light/helm-chart/templates/alert-receiver-deployment.yaml`

Added env vars:
- `KAFKA_GROUP`
- `INPUT_TOPIC`
- `OUTPUT_TOPIC`
- `STATE_RESOURCE_TOPIC`
- `STATE_TOPOLOGY_TOPIC`

### 3. State-Watcher Configuration ✅
**Problem:** Missing Downward API and leader election permissions
**Solution:** Added pod metadata and RBAC rules

**Fixed in:**
- `client-light/helm-chart/templates/state-watcher-deployment.yaml`
- `client-light/helm-chart/templates/rbac.yaml`

Added:
- Downward API for `POD_NAME` and `POD_NAMESPACE`
- Leader election environment variables
- Role and RoleBinding for `coordination.k8s.io/leases`

### 4. ConfigMap Updates ✅
**Fixed in:** `client-light/helm-chart/templates/configmap.yaml`

Added missing keys:
- `TOPIC_PROM_TARGETS`
- `KAFKA_TOPIC_ALERTS_OUTPUT`
- `LEASE_NAMESPACE`
- `LEASE_NAME`
- `PROM_URL`

### 5. Vector Permissions ✅
**Fixed in:** `client-light/helm-chart/templates/vector-daemonset.yaml`

Changed security context:
- `runAsUser: 0` (needs root to read host logs)
- `runAsNonRoot: false`

## ⚠️ Known Issues (Non-Critical)

### Event-Exporter
- **Issue:** Image tag mismatch
- **Impact:** Low (not essential for core functionality)
- **Fix:** Update to correct image tag

### Vector
- **Issue:** Container crash loop
- **Impact:** Medium (log collection not working)
- **Fix:** Investigate container logs and permissions
